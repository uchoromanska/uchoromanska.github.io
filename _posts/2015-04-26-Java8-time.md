Lets assume you have a simple task to create specific date (for example 01-12-2016) and print it on the screen. How would it look like in Java 7?

{% highlight java %}
DateFormat formatter = new SimpleDateFormat("dd-MM-yyyy");
Date date = null;
try {
   date = formatter.parse("01-12-2016");
} catch (ParseException e) {
   // handle parse exception
}
System.out.println(formatter.format(date));
{% endhighlight %}

Add one day to given date:

{% highlight java %}
Calendar calendar = Calendar.getInstance();
calendar.setTime(date);
calendar.add(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH, 1);
Date dayAfter = calendar.getTime();
System.out.println(formatter.format(dayAfter));
{% endhighlight %}


Does that rings a bell? Probably <a href="http://www.joda.org/joda-time/" target="_blank">Joda library</a> would be a better choice..
{% highlight java %}
DateTimeFormatter formatterJoda = DateTimeFormat.forPattern("dd-MM-yyyy");
DateTime jodaDate = DateTime.parse("01-12-2016", formatterJoda);
System.out.println(formatterJoda.print(jodaDate));

DateTime dayAfter = jodaDate.plusDays(1);
System.out.println(formatterJoda.print(dayAfter));
{% endhighlight %}


In java 8 that's much simpler. Take a look:

{% highlight java %}
DateTimeFormatter formatter = DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern("dd-MM-yyyy");
LocalDate date = LocalDate.parse("01-12-2016", formatter);
System.out.println(formatter.format(date));
{% endhighlight %}
or
{% highlight java %}
LocalDate date = LocalDate.of(2016, Month.DECEMBER, 1);
System.out.println(formatter.format(date));
{% endhighlight %}

and
{% highlight java %}
LocalDate dateAfter = date.plusDays(1);
System.out.println(dayAfter);
{% endhighlight %}

Those are really simple and basic examples but in my opinion they show the simplicity and clarity of date-time API usage in java 8. 
So what's happened here? Oracle and author of Joda library Stephen Colebourne joined forces.
  
First of all, new date time API is thread-safe (also date time formatters which was a big burden in previous version of java). Most of the classes create objects that are immutable, so after the object is created, it cannot be modified.

What you'll notice first are LocalDate and LocalTime classes that are representation of date and time values. There's also a composite class called LocalDateTime which purpose can be easily guessed. If you need to express time in specific time zone - ZonedDateTime is there for you.

Example how date can be created
{% highlight java %}
LocalDate date = LocalDate.of(2015, 4, 26);
{% endhighlight %}

And safer version for month because.. is January 0 or 1 ? (1 btw)
{% highlight java %}
LocalDate date = LocalDate.of(2015, Month.APRIL, 26); 
{% endhighlight %}

Date and time combined
{% highlight java %}
LocalTime now = LocalTime.now();
LocalTime after8hours = now.plus(8, HOURS);
LocalDateTime dateTime = date.atTime(after8hours);
{% endhighlight %}

Date manipulation
{% highlight java %}
LocalDateTime now = LocalDateTime.now();
LocalDateTime dayInPast = now.withDayOfMonth(02).withYear(2014);
LocalDateTime earlierDate = dayInPast.plusWeeks(2).plus(3, ChronoUnit.WEEKS);
{% endhighlight %}
 
Enum ChronoUnit is particularly interesting. We can use it to add to date second, days, months, centuries and even - forever (ChronoUnit.FOREVER) which is Long max value.

## Adjusters

According to documentation - a block of code that can be used to wrap up common processing logic. API provides some predefined adjusters but also those could be defined from scratch.
Some examples:
{% highlight java %}
LocalDateTime now = LocalDateTime.now();
LocalDateTime nextMonthFirstDay = now.with(TemporalAdjusters.firstDayOfNextMonth());
{% endhighlight %}

Adjusts the date to the first occurrence of the specified day-of-week before the date being adjusted unless it is already on that day in which case the same object is returned.
{% highlight java %}
LocalDateTime lastMonday = now.with(TemporalAdjusters.previousOrSame(DayOfWeek.MONDAY));

LocalDateTime nextMonday = now.with(TemporalAdjusters.next(DayOfWeek.FRIDAY));

//next friday after 26.02.2025
LocalDateTime nextFriday = LocalDateTime.of(2025, Month.FEBRUARY, 26, 12, 30).with(TemporalAdjusters.next(DayOfWeek.FRIDAY));
{% endhighlight %}

To create custom adjuster create a class that implements TemporalAdjuster interface. There'll be one method that needs to be implemented - adjustInto.
The SendSmsReminderAdjuster shown below, adjust date of sending sms reminder to client. Such communication should be send in a week time but not on weekend.  
{% highlight java %}
public class SendSmsReminderAdjuster implements TemporalAdjuster {
    
    public Temporal adjustInto(Temporal temporal) {
        LocalDate date = LocalDate.from(temporal);
        date = date.plusWeeks(1);
        if (date.getDayOfWeek() == DayOfWeek.SATURDAY ||
                date.getDayOfWeek() == DayOfWeek.SUNDAY) {
            date = date.with(TemporalAdjusters.next(DayOfWeek.MONDAY));
        }
        return temporal.with(date);
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

example of usage
{% highlight java %}
LocalDate nextDateOfSending = date.with(new PaydayAdjuster());
{% endhighlight %}

given date: 20.04.2015 Monday, calculated date: 27.04.2015 Monday

given date: 25.04.2015 Saturday, calculated date: 04.05.2015 Monday

## Clock and zones

The current time is represented by the Clock class. Static method now() provides the current date and time using the system clock and the default time zone.
When there's a need to express time in specific time zone ZoneId can be used. For example:

{% highlight java %}
ZoneId id = ZoneId.of("Europe/Paris");
ZonedDateTime zoned = ZonedDateTime.of(dateTime, id);
{% endhighlight %}

Other methods that can be useful:
{% highlight java %}
Clock.systemUTC() //a clock representing the Greenwich/UTC time zone.
Clock.systemDefaultZone();
{% endhighlight %}

## Periods

Period define a distance in a timeline. For instance, period of 4 years, 1 month and 24 days can be expressed as follows:

{% highlight java %}
Period period = Period.of(4, 1, 24);
{% endhighlight %}

We can use them to manipulate dates. Example:
{% highlight java %}
LocalDate futureDate = now.plus(period);
{% endhighlight %}

## Durations 

Duration is a distance on the timeline measured in terms of time. It's similar to Period but has different precision.
 
A duration of 55 seconds and 3 nanoseconds
{% highlight java %}
Duration duration = Duration.ofSeconds(55, 3);
{% endhighlight %}

Duration of one day
{% highlight java %}
Duration oneDay = Duration.between(today, yesterday);
{% endhighlight %}

## Conclusion
That was only a brief introduction into Java 8 new date and time API. Examples shown it this article are strong proof that API is designed well and worth exploring. Feel encouraged :)
