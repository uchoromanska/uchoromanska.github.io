Create specific date:
DateFormat formatter = new SimpleDateFormat("dd-MM-yyyy");
Date date = null;
try {
   date = formatter.parse("01-12-2016");
} catch (ParseException e) {
   // handle parse exception
}
System.out.println("date = " + formatter.format(date));

Add one date to given date:

Calendar calendar = Calendar.getInstance();
 calendar.setTime(date);
 calendar.add(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH, 1);
 Date specificDate = calendar.getTime();
 System.out.println("specificDate = " + formatter.format(specificDate));


Does that rings a bell? Probably Joda library would be better choice..


In java 8 that's much simpler. Take a look:


Those are really simple and basic examples but in my opinion they show the simplicity and clarity of date-time  API usage in java 8. 
So what's happened here? Oracle and author of Joda library Stephen Colebourne joined forces.
  
First of all new date time API is thread-safe (also date time formatters which was a big burden in previous version of java). Most of the classes create objects that are immutable, so after the object is created, it cannot be modified.

What you'll notice first are LocalDate and LocalTime classes that are representation od date and time values. There's also a composite class called LocalDateTime which purpose can be easily guessed.
