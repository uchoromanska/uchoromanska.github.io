This year, thanks to my company 4Finance IT, I had a pleasure to attend to Spring I/O conference that took place in Barcelona. It had an amazing lineup of speakers from companies like Pivotal, Google, ElasticSearch, JetBrains or MongoDb that shared their knowledge in fields of Spring, Groovy, Grails and many other.

Conference in numbers:

- 2 days,
- 41 speakers, 
- 4 lines of lectures and workshops, 
- 40 lectures,
- 6 workshops,
- approximately 350 attendees

## Lectures
As mentioned above, there were three parallel lines of lectures therefore every time I had to choose one of three talks. Sometimes this decision was not easy to make. I’ll focus only on two talks that inspired me the most.

My personal favourite was <b>Dustin Whittle</b> with <b>“Performance Testing Crash Course”</b>.
Dustin showed how performance of application affects business by user experience. His presentation contained description of numerous performance testing tools like:

- Apache Bench
- Sproxy
- Siege
- Apache JMeter
- Bees With Machine Guns (seriously - how cool is that?)
- Google PageSpeed
- WBench

and many many more…

I highly recommend to watch this lecture to understand how to automate performance tests and evaluate the impact that performance has on business side of application.


Another great talk - <b>“Inside an Spring Event Sourced CQRS application - or why Microservices can actually work”</b> by <b>Eugen Paraschiv</b>. 

In this lecture author shared his experience of building and deploying event sourced CQRS Spring application. Showed how commands lead to events, events to an event based system, and how these events get projected into useful views. Finally, he explained why Projections are in fact - micoservices.

## Organization

The conference was organized quite well but there was few things that could be improved. 

Event took place in AXA auditorium. Lectures were given in four rooms - one big conference room and three smaller rooms. Surprisingly, the most interesting talks were given in those smaller places, thus it was quite crowded. 

Coffee was served only during two breaks, only by waiters which led to long queues.

Finally - every attendee got a  gift pack which contained t-shirt. Unfortunately there were only men t-shirt, nobody thought about those (approximately) 10 women ;)

Big advantage of the conference was its place - Barcelona, one of the most beautiful cities in Span.

I’m very happy that I could attend to Spring I/O Conference. For everyone that couldn’t make it, small summary:
